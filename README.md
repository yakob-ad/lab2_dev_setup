# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Running

To run the site using Live Preview in VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the 
Command Palette, then select `Live Preview: Start Server`. You can copy the URL 
from the VS Code Live Preview and paste it into a web browser such as Chrome to 
view the site externally.

To end Live Preview, open Command Palette and select `Live Preview: Stop Server`.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
